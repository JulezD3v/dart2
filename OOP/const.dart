/*1. Create a Car class with the following:
A named constructor that takes brand and year and model that sets year to 1990 by default.
Add a method which calculates the age of the car and prints it
Instantiate both and print their details.

2.You are designing a BankAccount class.
Add deposit(double amount) and withdraw(double amount) methods.
Ensure withdrawal cannot exceed the balance.
Test by creating an account and performing transactions.

3.Write a function int divide(int a, int b) that:
Throws an exception when b == 0.
Otherwise returns the result of a ~/ b.
Call it inside try-catch-finally and print messages for success, error, and cleanup.
4.Design a User class with:
A constructor requiring username and password.
Throw an exception if the password is shorter than 6 characters.
In main(), attempt to create multiple User objects and handle exceptions gracefully.
5. (The room is expected to discuss and share a response for this question) Imagine you are designing a Car class for a ride-hailing app.
What fields and methods would you include?
How would you use constructors to handle a  brand-new car being registered?
